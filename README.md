A simple starter template for working with C++ projects made with CMake.

# Folder structure

There are two folders in this project structure: build and source.
In the source folder you need to ensure to create an "include" folder and a "lib" folder.
In the build folder you need to ensure to create a "temp" folder and run the instruction commands from that location in your terminal.
